This demo has originally been developed for MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) as part of the following article:

- [Responding to light conditions - MDN App Center](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Developing/gather_and_modify_data/Responding_to_light_conditions)

Try it [live](http://goo.gl/Dzc59h).

## Notes

- Currently the Ambient Light API is supported only by Firefox and Firefox for Android.
- Portable devices such as MacBooks and Android tablets usually have an ambient light sensor.
- The demo does not support small resolutions very well at present.
- The app has been made using HTML + CSS + Javascript, with no libs and using static data.
