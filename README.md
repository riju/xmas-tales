# XMAS Tales

XMAS Tales is an e-book reader app for kids that uses the Ambient Light API to respond to different light conditions with special effects, to impress children with the magic of Christmas.

It has originally been developed for [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Developing/gather_and_modify_data/retrieving_battery_status_information) that looks at one way to respond to light conditions in the context of Open Web Apps: The Ambient Light API.

The demo is published [here](http://www.francesco.iovine.name/mdn/xmas-tales/public_html/).
